### Writing to file 

Everything we have done so far has only modified the data in R; the files have remained unchanged. Whenever we want to save our datasets to file, we need to use a `write` function in R. 

To write our matrix to file in comma separated format (.csv), we can use the `write.csv` function. There are two required arguments: the variable name of the data structure you are exporting, and the path and filename that you are exporting to. By default the delimiter is set, and columns will be separated by a comma:

```r
write.csv(sub_meta, file="data/subset_meta.csv")
```

Similar to reading in data, there are a wide variety of functions available allowing you to export data in specific formats. Another commonly used function is `write.table`, which allows you to specify the delimiter you wish to use. This function is commonly used to create tab-delimited files.

> **NOTE:** Sometimes when writing a dataframe with row names to file, the column names will align starting with the row names column. To avoid this, you can include the argument `col.names = NA` when writing to file to ensure all of the column names line up with the correct column values.

Writing a vector of values to file requires a different function than the functions available for writing dataframes. You can use `write()` to save a vector of values to file. For example:

```r
write(glengths, file="data/genome_lengths.txt", ncolumns=1)
```

> ### An R package for data wrangling
> The methods presented above are using base R functions for data wrangling. Later we will explore the **Tidyverse suite of packages**, specifically designed to make data wrangling easier.
